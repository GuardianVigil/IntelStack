## 🔌 API Integration

```python
import requests

API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
BASE_URL = 'http://your-intelstack-instance/api/v1'

# Quick threat check
response = requests.post(f'{BASE_URL}/analyze', 
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'},
    json={'indicator': 'example.com', 'type': 'domain'}
)
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key
```
